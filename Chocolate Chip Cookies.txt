Light Brown Sugar, Lightly Packed | ¾ cup     |                  |
Kosher Salt                       | 1 tsp     |                  |
Water                             | as needed |                  |


1:   Make the toffee: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2:   In a medium nonstick saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, brown sugar, and salt, stirring until evenly incorporated. If there are grainy lumps or if the fat starts to separate, add a couple splashes of water and stir vigorously to emulsify. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 290°F (143°C), about 10-15 minutes.
3:   Pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet and spread out slightly with a spatula. Freeze until ready to use, about 30 minutes.

vanilla extract                   | 2 tsp     |                  |
All-Purpose Flour                 | 2½ cups   |                  |
50-70% Cacao Chocolate, Chopped   | 6 oz      |                  |
Sea salt, for sprinkling          | as needed |                  |


1:   Add the butter to a medium nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns dark brown and smells nutty. Watch carefully so the butter does not burn. Remove the pot from the heat.
2:   Add an ice cube to the butter and slowly let it melt. It may froth and bubble. Add the remaining 3 ice cubes and gently stir until melted.
3:   In a large bowl, combine the granulated and brown sugar, espresso powder, salt, and baking soda. 
4:   Pour the brown butter into the sugar mixture and mix until combined. Don’t worry if it looks separated.
5:   In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Pour into the sugar and butter mixture and whisk until glossy and smooth.
6:   Add the flour and fold with a rubber spatula to incorporate until the dough has no visible flour streaks.
7:   Remove the toffee from the freezer (it should be a frozen disc) and break it into chunks that will fit inside a gallon zip-top bag. Double bag the toffee and seal both bags. With a rolling pin, break the toffee into small pieces.
8:   Fold the crushed toffee and chopped chocolate into the dough until evenly distributed.
9:   Using a large ice cream scoop or a ½ cup measure, scoop the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Wrap the baking sheet in plastic wrap, but leave a small opening at the corner of the tray.
10:  Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 48 hours. This will allow the flavor to develop and the dough to dry out a little as it rests, which will result in less spread when it bakes.
